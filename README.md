<h4>Issues faced in phase-I:</h4>
<h5>1. Had problems using Zomato API's. I was getting 500 Server Error, while using only request in python code.(Curl was working fine)<br>
Solved it by adding header = {"User-agent": "curl/7.43.0", "Accept": "application/json", "user_key": "YOUR_API_USER_KEY"}
</h5>
<h2>PHASE - II In Progress</h2>
