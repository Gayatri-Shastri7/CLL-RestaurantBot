# CLL-RestaurantBot
<h3>Built this Restaurant Bot using RASA</h3>
<h2>PHASE - I</h2>
<h4>It takes input from user location and cuisine and displays top  Restaurants with all available cuisines and it's rating.</h4>
<h4>Please provide comments or suggestions for improving this bot</h4>

<h2>PHASE - II In Progress</h2>
<h4>-Duckling ->(for date,time) extraction using docker</h4>
<h4>-Forms -> for booking table(user input: phone no and no. of people)</h4>

<h2>PHASE - III Deploy In Facebook</h2>

<h2> How RASA Chatbot Works? </h2>
<h3>How Dialogue Handling with Rasa Core can use LSTM by using Supervised and Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:<h3/>
<h4>
The Rasa core and Rasa NLU are open source python libraries for creating conversational software. Their purpose is to make machine-learning based dialogue management and language understanding accessible to non-specialist software developers. The main component of the model is a recurrent neural network (an LSTM), which maps from raw dialog history directly to a distribution over system actions. The LSTM automatically infers a representation of dialog history, which relieves the system developer of much of the manual feature engineering of dialog state. In addition, the developer can provide software that expresses business rules and provides access to programmatic APIs, enabling the LSTM to take actions in the real world on behalf of the user. The LSTM can be optimized using supervised learning (SL), where a domain expert provides example dialogs which the LSTM should imitate; or using reinforcement learning (RL), where the system improves by interacting directly with end users.</h4>
